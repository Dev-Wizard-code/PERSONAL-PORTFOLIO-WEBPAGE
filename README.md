TASK-3

To design a basic portfolio website, we will create a responsive single-page layout using HTML and CSS, structured with sections like Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The navigation bar will use anchor links (<a href="#section">) for smooth scrolling to each section, and the Projects section will showcase individual project cards with images, titles, and brief descriptions. The design will be mobile-friendly using flexible grid or flexbox layouts, media queries for responsiveness, and a clean, professional color scheme. Styling will include subtle hover effects, soft shadows, and rounded corners to enhance the visual appeal, while fonts will be chosen for readability and elegance. The final site will be fully functional and visually polished, ideal for presenting a developerâ€™s work online.
